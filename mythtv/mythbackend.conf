# User who should start the mythbackend process
#
# Running mythbackend as non-root requires you to ensure that audio/video
# devices used for recording have suitable user permissions. One way
# to achieve this is to modify existing or create new udev rules which
# assign these devices to a non-root group with rw permissions and add
# your mythbackend user to that group. Be aware that console.perms can 
# also affect device permissions and may need additional configuration.
# Running as non-root may also introduce increased process latency.
#
# MBE_USER='root'
